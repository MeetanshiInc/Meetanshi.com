<p>Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in fear among people’s minds. Very few people preferred coming out of their house. As a result, store owners are facing many challenges in terms of finance, promoting their sales and managing crowd at a particular time. Hence, to overcome these Meetanshi has developed Magento 2 Retail Store Appointment extension that facilitates merchants to schedule appointments for their customers online in the Magento 2 store.</p>

<p>The extension helps in improving the customer experience of your retail store by managing the appointments such that no crowd is gathered at a particular point of time. Thus, this helps in maintaining social distance and improving the efficiency of the store.</p>

<p>Magento 2 Retail Store Appointment module also helps the staff members to work effectively and without any work load. For a retail store, having limited capacity it would be an added advantage that the customers won’t have to wait standing out in the long queue for hours to have a trial or either looking for the products.</p>

<p>The key benefit is by integrating with Google Calendar to remind the customer about an appointment by creating an event in it and push them to visit the store. The module is also useful for merchants offering salon services, where taking prior appointments is necessary.</p>

<p>Hence, the Magento 2 Retail Store Appointment extension is a must-have extension in this Covid-19 and post Covid-19 situation.</p>
